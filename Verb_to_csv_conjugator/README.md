Setting up some place to work inside while creating confidence in working in a new environment.

Feel welcomed in my public repository. 

Currently I´m working on a private project to get the conjugations of portuguese verbs into a csv format that could be read by ANKI to create flashcards for studying. The source of the vocabulary is https://www.conjugacao.com.br/
Any inputs are welcome - though I´d like to challange myself by doing most of it by myself
